# Adapter Design Pattern :
This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines 
the capability of two independent interfaces. Consider the example of adapter 
which helps to convert the international pins to indian pin.

The Adaptar design pattern is mainly used when we want to integrate third 
party api's in our system.

An Adapter Pattern says that just "converts the interface of a class into another 
interface that a client wants".

# Advantage of Adapter Pattern
## It allows two or more previously incompatible objects to interact.
## It allows reusability of existing functionality.

# Adapter makes two existing interfaces work together
# Use Adapter when you have an interface you cannot change, but which you need to use.
